Being a scientist in dark times.

As a scientist, in principle, you are comfortable with not knowing.
you wait until scientists find ways to unlock nature’s mysteries.
you try to do it yourself as well. You may build theories but you wait for the data
that will be meticulously mined from nature and prove a theory or not.
you don’t let yourself slip into fantasies, like God(s) and Satan(s), just to fill in the gaps.
Same if you are researching the behavior, mind and brain of the people, as eg a neuroscientist.
Underneath this behavior though is your belief that nature doesn’t lie,
it has no intention to hide itself, it is under your control,
and if it lies you have a way and you are free to use it in order to understand it.
So you wait without knowing, actively researching.
someday maybe you know or maybe you won’t,  it’s fine, no one is hurt, at least because of waiting.  

What happens now though when your under research system lies, you can’t get data,
it tries to stop you and silence you when you try to understand it,
and in the mean time it does horrors that you witness day after day?  

This is the state of the system that we are trying to understand today,
as human beings, but you happen to also be a scientist.  

You could wait until it decides to show you itself, but you know this won’t happen.
You could be ok with it, but waiting hurts defenseless people and yourself with which you are not ok.  

Like in the COVID era, you could tell that it was an international subjugation of people,
but as a scientist you knew that knowledge takes time, makes mistakes and you waited for
the vaccine to be found by scientists. Because with the vaccine people would be protected,
and lives would be saved. So you were patient and accepted the to be short-term subjugation.
Again you were assuming that people overall actually cared about people’s lives. Well, this ship has already sailed.  

When it comes to politics, as a system you want to understand, you see that lying is its basis and not only
it openly withholds data and information, but goes after you if you try to make sense of it. In this case you
can’t wait for the data, they won’t allow you to have all the data.
You could wait until the rich and powerful decide to expose themselves but you know that this won’t happen.
You could be ok with being in the dark, as you are used to as a scientist, but your moral self doesn’t let you sleep at night.  

This is when morality hits the scientist and makes her wonder what she can do.  

So what can you do? You can’t have data and as a moral human being you feel the pressure of exposing the truth
and protecting defenseless victims, like children and oppressed people.
Waiting won't change anything, it will only make it worse. You can’t afford to wait, you try to understand with
whatever you have at your disposal, regarding data and tools.  

What are the tools that you can use on the little scrambled data you have?  

Again, as in history that I was saying earlier, our last resort is to study it at its interface,
with human psychology and analyzing language. For example, who compares food with human flesh?
Who finds funny to simulate sacrificing a baby to a devil? How can you walk a jerky beef?  
and so on.
