some more preliminary thoughts..  

How is it that all these VIP "intellectuals" turn out to be so stupid, with such "poor judgment", as they or their friends say after they have been exposed to be associated with human trafficking and farming ring?
It makes you think what we haven't talked about enough that lies in the heart of epistemology. The sociology of knowledge. How is it that throughout history mostly famous in the realm of thinking and knowledge are men, and why some specific ones? Is it because what they say is indeed so deep, unique, and important for humanity or is it the result of the privilege of attention and money from their associates with similar privileges, and the structures they build, apparently based on the abuse, oppression of women and the burial of their thoughts?
Could it be that what it is true is what it is agreed to be true by those who are heard and paid attention to?
If you observe the history of thinking and knowledge there is not much of novelty. Core ideas are reiterated every few generations in a different language and context, presented as new.

Their voices are heard and they enjoy fame that comes from associations and their position in the thinking network. Enterprises, funded and associated by abusers, like edge.org of John Brockman, "Closer to the truth" of Robert Kuhn, pouring money and attention, claim to know what's profound and worthy of being heard, and it is reinforced by those who want to be in their ranks, accepting it like a herd, driven by their ambition.

If we really want to get closer to the "truth" we need to liberate ourselves from admiring persons over ideas and from lusting to be admired.

How do we do that? The big obstacle is resources. It is indeed very hard to engage in deep thinking and research when you are struggling for survival and when you are taking care of others. You need time, free of distractions, to do that. Funding brings money, admiration brings funding. Our academic structures promote the "publish or perish" mechanism, leading to accumulation of money and fame in a few, ie academic capitalism, and all others trying to become like them. How can this change?
One first thought is by democratizing thinking. Thinking cannot be a privilege of the few. Sure, everybody thinks, but the question is what makes someone to be heard and be part of the discussion. Academic Elites and VIPs limit human advance in knowledge and understanding of the world and life.
First thing is to stop being impressed by names. Second, to grant access to resources to anyone who is willing to put the time and energy on knowledge pursuit, like a public good, after a proper public education. Third have horizontal platforms where their thoughts and work are presented and easily searched and discussed. Something like what is happening with the social media, but maybe less chaotic. What else?
