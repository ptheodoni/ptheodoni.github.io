*Theoretical and computational neuroscience in Greece is severely underdeveloped, to the extent that there are very few positions/courses on it, and scientists from relevant disciplines like physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists barely know what it is, if at all, still.  

Also, there is still plenty of room for development in terms of equity, diversity, and open access.  

Neurotheoria (Νευροθεωρία)'s mission is to spread the word to the Greek community about theoretical and computational neuroscience, physics, philosophy (and their interaction) and relevant academic issues (including equity, diversity, open access).  

Disclaimer: some posts could be about my scientific journey and/or commented based on my personal opinion/view.*
