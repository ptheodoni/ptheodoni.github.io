*"Science as a Hobby" is a project to bridge the gap between Society and Academia by providing direct public interactive access to academic and scientific research.  
The initial approach is via Open Mics in New York City, where I go on stage and offer my knowledge to the people there in an interactive way.  
This makes a big difference, as I think that the Science-Society gap won't be bridged if the communication is unidirectional.  
The next step, if the first goes well, will be to invite more scientists and philosophers to join me on stage.  
And the goal is to have centers where people can go and practice science as a hobby.  
Anyone can do it, they don't need to be professional scientists in order to learn how to do research.  
That's the idea. So far it has received enthusiastic positive comments and people want me to keep doing it. Let's see how it goes.*

Episode 1: Introduction

*At the Open Mic, at Chispa caf√©/bar in Bushwick, Brooklyn, NY, USA.  
It was the first time and it was about introducing the idea to the audience and getting their feedback, which was very fruitful.  
There was some intro on the science of neuroscience and the science of consciousness.*
