presentations 
====
*here are slides of talks, journal clubs, and lab meetings I've given throughout the years. I'll be adding more as time passes if I find them in the abysm of my fileworld. usually when I am giving a lab meeting, journal club I search the literature as much as possible, so you may find the slides useful. most of my talks contain results still unpublished so it may take a while to upload those*
