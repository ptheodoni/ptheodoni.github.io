Currently, I am working on
====
 

in neuroscience
------
(in current decreasing priority)  
- a large-scale multi-regional neural network model of distributed conscious content  
- a local neural network model to explain noise correlation of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex
- a consensus marmoset-macaque cortical parcellation and the comparison of their mesoscale connectomes  
- a large-scale multi-regional neural network model of the marmoset for working   memory, in comparison to that of the macaque  
- modeling social decision-making (game theory) - theory of mind


​
in philosophy  
------
(in current decreasing priority)  
- foundations of science  
- philosophy of science: quantum theories of consciousness  
- history of philosophy: ancient Greek women philosophers  
- philosophy of mind: no report paradigm

**in neuroscience:**
----
local neural network models for
-  perceptual decision-making
-  conscious perception
-  learning
-  episodic memory
  
Large-scale multi-regional neural network models for  
- conscious access

analysis of the marmoset cortico-cortical connectivity, and their comparison across species  


**in physics:**
----
- formation of thin films (experiment)
- photonic crystals (both experiment and theory, simulations)
